tt0110175	Jacob	1994	Action,Biography,Crime,Drama,History	en	91	"In the foreign land of Canaan lives Isaac, son of Abraham, with his clever, strong-willed wife Rebekah and his twin sons Esau and Jacob. The first-born, Esau, is a strong and fearless hunter with a voracious appetite for sensual pleasures. Jacob is a shepherd, more tender and compassionate han Esau. Just as Esau is the pride of his father, so is Jacob the apple of his mother's eye. Rebekah is convinced that Jacob, though the second born son, is the chosen one and the rightful heir of Isaac and Abraham. And she tells him that when she was with child, God announced to her: ""Two nations are within thy womb. Two manner of men shall be delivered to you. The one shall be stronger than the other and the elder shall serve the younger"". One day Esau returns from a hunt to find Jacob preparing a lentil porridge. Famished, he asks Jacob for some food. Jacob agrees, but on one condition: that Esau sell him his birthright. Since Esau ascribes little value to its meaning, he readily agrees and they conclude the pact. Time has passed. Isaac has grown old and nearly blind. It is time to pass on his paternal blessing to the firstborn. He asks Esau to hunt and prepare some game for him, after which he will give him his blessing. Rebekah knows she must act now. Cornering Jacob, she pressures him into deceiving Isaac so that he obtains the blessing instead of Esau. Jacob resists, but when Rebekah vows to take the blame for this ploy, he finally consents. And thus does Jacob trick his father. When Esau returns from the hunt and appears before his father, he explodes in anger when he learns of the scheme. Having obtained only a lesser blessing from Isaac, he vows to kill Jacob as soon as his father passes away. Isaac, following Rebekah's suggestion, advises Jacob to flee to Harran, to the home of Laban - Rebekah's brother, and to ask him to marry one of his daughters. Laden with gold, silver, skins, spices and oils, Jacob sadly leaves his home and his loved ones. Soon, however, he realizes that he is being followed: a Canaanite, one of Esau's brothers-in-law, robs him of the treasure that was to be his dowry. One night, as he is asleep, Jacob has a vision of a stairway with oscar-like figures on it. During this vision God promises him protection and prosperity. The next morning, Jacob swears to remain faithful and devoted to God. After an arduous journey, Jacob arrives in Harran. Haggard and drained of his strength, he immediately forgets his fatigue when he sees a pretty young girl at the fountain. The girl is Rachel, the youngest daughter of his uncle Laban. And Jacob falls head over heels in love with her. Though Laban greets his nephew heartily, he cannot conceal his disappointment that Jacob has arrived without any gifts. Laban's two sons, Morash and Be'or, are less delighted by Jacob's arrival. Jacob soon asks Laban to let him marry Rachel, and he even accepts Laban's rigorous conditions: that Jacob become his indentured servant for a full seven years. Jacob proves to be a singularly successful herdsman and contributes mightily to the welfare of Laban's people. Thus after seven years, Laban is unwilling to let him leave and devises a cunning scheme... When Jacob awakens on the morning following the consummation of his marriage with Rachel, he is horrified to discover that he has slept with Rachel's older sister Leah instead. Laban forced Leah to take her sister's place in the dark tent. As Jacob rages, Laban claims that according to the law of the land, a father must marry off his older daughter first. He is willing, however, to make Jacob another offer: for another seven years in his service, he can take Rachel as his wife in one week's time. And again, Laban and his people enjoy seven more years of rich harvests and expanding flocks, all thanks to Jacob's superior abilities. But while the unloved Leah bears Jacob many children, Rachel, his one and only love, remains barren for many years, until Joseph finally sees the light of day. After his second period of indenture is over, Jacob strikes another deal with Laban, whereby he is allowed to assemble his own herd. His prosperity soon sparks the envy of Laban's sons Morash and Be'or, who accuse Jacob of deceiving them and of stealing their property. Jacob decides it is time to move back to Canaan, and flees with his wives, children and servants. As soon as Laban hears about their escape, he rounds up his sons and his men and gives chase. He finally meets up with Jacob on Mount Gilead. But before he can reach Jacob, God appears to Laban and warns him not to harm Jacob or his people. Jacob's most grueling ordeal, however, still awaits him: his meeting with his brother Esau. Fearing that Esau still intends to kill him, Jacob sends messengers with gifts to his brother to announce his coming. The messengers return sooner than expected, reporting that Esau is already on his way to meet him - with 400 armed men. Jacob sets up camp on the banks of the river Jabbok. That night, while his people await Esau with fear and trembling, Jacob withdraws to collect himself on the other side of the river. There Jacob is attacked by a mysterious being whom he cannot identify. It is an oscar. As the struggle intensifies and the oscar realizes that he cannot subdue Jacob, he strikes him fiercely on the hip. But Jacob, who gradually realizes who his adversary is, continues to grapple with him and refuses to relinquish his hold until the oscar has blessed him. Ultimately the oscar yields and gives Jacob the blessing together with the new name of ""Israel"". He thus confirms Jacob's right to the blessing which he originally obtained by deceit. The following morning, as Esau's army approaches, Jacob gathers his people behind him and awaits his brother. As Esau arrives at the head of his troops, Jacob humbly throws himself at his brother's feet. Esau breaks the tension by coming towards Jacob with open arms and welcoming him home. Reconciling their past differences, Jacob and Esau embrace."	NULL

When Terry, Susan and the chemist assistant, Fred Mays, leave to run some tests, Maynard is abruptly confronted by the figure from the roof. The man identifies himself as Ormand Murks and reminds Maynard that five years previously, the doctor had placed Murks in Brookdale Mental Institute, under the care of Dr. Garland. Two years later, Garland had brought Murks to Maynard for treatment, but Murks had died on the operating table of no apparent cause. The only malady from which Murks had suffered was an obsessive desire for blood transfusions, which he believed would make him immortal. Murks had requested no autopsy be allowed and that his body be returned to his brother at the Murks estate, Greenwood Knowle. Maynard is astounded by Murks's tale and Murks goes on to tell him that through voodoo rights and devil potions, he has discovered the world between the living and the dead. When Maynard is skeptical, Murks kills him and takes his blood. Later, another figure slips into Maynard's office, going directly to the laboratory storage. Murks comes upon the man, his brother, who is responsible for stealing blood for Murks.

Back at Maynard's office, police detectives Blair and Hendricks find Terry and Susan and accuse them of murdering Maynard, but with little proof, they depart. Soon afterward, Susan opens the lab refrigerator and the body of Fred falls out. He too has been strangled and embalmed. Blair and Hendricks, returning for further questions, arrest the pair. At headquarters both are grilled for the rest of the night but are released when another strangled and embalmed body is discovered. Returning to the office, Susan finds Murks's identification record in Maynard's waste basket, and she and Terry decide to investigate at the Murks's Greenwood Knowles estate. There, the couple make their way to the family mausoleum and discover that Murks's crypt is open and empty. Murks has seen the couple go into the vault and tries trapping them, but Terry frees them by breaking down the door. Still seeking evidence, Terry and Susan go into the main house, where they discover an undertaking table and the body of Dr. Garland, the head of the Brookdale Institute. Blair and Hendricks, having followed the two to Greenwood, appear and again accuse them of murder. Terry tries to show Blair Garland's body, but it has vanished. After Terry demands that he be allowed to show Blair the suspicious crypt, Susan is left behind at the house, guarded by a policeman. In the mausoleum, Garland's body is found in Murks's crypt while at the house the policeman is knocked unconscious. When Terry and Blair return, they realize that Susan and Blair's car has disappeared. Using the signals transmitted from the car's faulty police radio, Blair and the police track the car to Maynard's office, where they find a hypnotized Susan giving Murks a blood transfusion. Murks makes his escape with the nurse and flees to the rooftop with Terry in pursuit. Just as Murks commands Susan to shoot Terry, Blair arrives and shoots Murks, who topples from the building.

An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance-chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouru00e9 Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out-of-court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light.

They are also only three of twelve remaining members of the Witches Council, the dwindling numbers due to one form of attrition or another. Of the next generation, Matt Andover and Lizzy Paris are on the executive of the company, while Colin Tate, who has never demonstrated any warlock powers and thus has always felt the black sheep of the group, has left the company to lead a mortal life in a want to feel like he belongs. Colin leaving the company was much to the dismay of his father, Jason Tate, especially as he feels like the Andovers and Parises are making moves to consolidate their power leaving the Tates out in the cold. The latest such move is the announcement of Matt and Lizzy's engagement, the wedding to take place in one week on Halloween. In reality, the marriage, arranged largely by Matt's widowed mother Abby, was purely to protect Matt, who on his thirty-sixth birthday in a couple of months, will lose his warlock powers as is tradition if he is not married by then, although the tradition has never really been tested. Both Matt and Lizzy agree to the marriage seeing as to the small dating pool with that attrition of eligible families, that agreement despite neither Matt or Lizzy truly loving the other in that romantic sense. While Matt has largely used his powers for the small conveniences in life as well as to charm women, his dating life largely consisting of one or two dates with each woman, he makes a true connection with a woman he meets at Colin's early Halloween costume party, he only knowing her first name, Sara. Matt and Sara are up front about their dating situations - Matt being engaged in an arranged marriage, and Sara in a long distance relationship with her physicist boyfriend, Alex, the two who only see each other a few times a year - stopping them from pursuing anything with each other despite their attraction. But what happens in sharing a single kiss at the end of the party leads to Matt's powers slowly being transferred to Sara. When Matt finally learns what is happening with the help of his mother, they, with Colin's help, try to locate Sara with what little information Matt was able to glean from their short time together. In the process, some truths come to light which may affect what happens within this collective.	NULL

tt6223974	The Farthest	2017	Action,Documentary,History	en	121	Is it humankind's greatest achievement? 12 billion miles away a tiny spaceship is leaving our Solar System and entering the void of deep space. It is the first human-made object ever to do so. Slowly dying within its heart is a plutonium generator that will beat for perhaps another decade before the lights on Voyager finally go out. But this little craft will travel on for millions of years, carrying a Golden Record bearing recordings and images of life on Earth. In all likelihood Voyager will outlive humanity and all our creations. It could be the only thing to mark our existence. Perhaps some day an alien will find it and wonder. The story of Voyager is an epic of human achievement, personal drama and almost miraculous success. Launched 16 days apart in Autumn 1977, the twin Voyager space probes have defied all the odds, survived countless near misses and almost 40 years later continue to beam revolutionary information across unimaginable distances. With less computing power than a modern hearing aid, they have unlocked the stunning secrets of our Solar System on a journey as revolutionary as the first circumnavigation of the globe and humankind's first footprint on the moon. In this powerful, poetic and cinematic feature documentary, THE FARTHEST celebrates these magnificent machines, the men and women who built them and the vision that propelled them farther than anyone could ever have hoped. Launched from a fractious planet, these pioneers sail on serenely in the darkness - an enduring testament to the ingenuity of humankind and the untapped limits of the human imagination. Passionate organic storytelling with people, images, archive and opinion woven with daring and brio makes THE FARTHEST a genuinely cinema-scale adventure.	NULL

tt10883124	Dads	2019	Action,Comedy,Documentary,Family	en	81	"Dads is a joyful exploration of contemporary fatherhood and a call to action for dads everywhere to take paternity leave. The film draws on the testimonies of famous funnymen such as Judd Apatow, Will Smith, Jimmy Fallon, Neil Patrick Harris, Kenan Thompson, Jimmy Kimmel, and Ken Jeong. Their reflections are combined with portraits of non-celebrity dads from different parts of the world - Brazil, Japan, the United States - who are creating new models of patriarchy. It's funny, heartwarming, and also revealing. (Apparently even professional comedians resort to dad jokes.) Among these voices, filmmaker Bryce Dallas Howard interweaves that of her own father, Ron Howard, who started his acting career as Opie, son of classic television father Andy Griffith. Interviewed by his daughter, Ron speaks movingly of his goal to meet the standard set by his real-life father, Rance. If the old-fashioned father was stern and stoic, the contemporary one is more vulnerable and self-deprecating. Conan O'Brien sums up parenthood as ""this incredible realization that you're not the most important person in the world."" Patton Oswalt, who became a single parent after his wife's death, reflects on how quickly kids grow up: ""You get the tiniest window and then it's gone just like that."" Hasan Minhaj pays tribute to his immigrant father, whose short-term sacrifice was for his family's long-term gain. Fathers can be close, distant, absent, or anything in between.

Remembering Zor-El's words about Brainiac's ideals, Superman knocks him out of the ship and they crash into a swamp. As he fights Braniac, Superman forces the cyborg to experience the chaos of life itself outside of his safe, artificial environments he created. Eventually, the combined mental and physical strain reaches its toll on Brainiac as he combusts and is reduced to ash and molten machinery. After restoring Metropolis, taking Kandor to another planet to restore it to its normal size to establish a Kryptonian colony, Superman makes his love life with Lois as Kent public with a marriage proposal. However, placed in the Fortress of Solitude, Brainiac's remains are still active.	PG-13
